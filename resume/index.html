				<h3 class="greeting">Hey, I'm Will</h3>

				<p>
					I love
					<em>programming</em>,
					<em>learning</em>,
					<em>solving problems</em>, and
					<em>building products</em> and
					<em>tools</em>. My
					<em>goal in life</em> is to do all these things as much as possible for as long as I can.
				</p>

				<p>
					I've worked in
					<a href="https://www.coursera.org">EdTech</a>, building a world-class platform for online learning, and helping to bring the best course content on the
					planet to millions of people for free.
				</p>

				<p>
					I've worked in
					<a href="https://www.davita.com">Healthcare</a>, building a platform where patients at all stages of renal failure could get the care and information
					they need to live a better life.
				</p>

				<p>
					I've worked in
					<a href="https://www.countertack.com">Cyber Security</a>, building a next-generation platform that helps businesses detect and neutralize historically hard-to-mitigate
					attacks called Advanced Persistent Threats.
				</p>

				<p>
					I've written production code in a dozen languages. My focus has always been on the
					<em>frontend</em>, but I love to code at any level of the stack, from desktop UIs to C libraries.

							During my time at Coursera I have helped with a full re-write of our platform to modernize it and support on-demand courses,
							organized two company-wide Make-a-Thons (our version of a Hack-a-Thon) and helped to improve the process for future
							organizing teams, wrote tooling and editor plugins for internal use, mentored several interns, worked on projects
							for new business models, advocated and helped to modernize our frontend development environment, and worked on a whole

						<p>
							My work at CounterTack was eclectic. I did everything from specing, mocking, prototyping and building Flex/AIR and Web applications
							and the backend services that feed them, to domain modeling, interaction and user experience design, interfacing with
							3rd party applications, developing use cases, raw socket development, and designing and implementing REST APIs in
							both Python and Ruby. Throughout my time at CounterTack, I wrote several internal usability assessments and libraries
							for internal customers that abstract away 3rd party APIs. I contributed to open source projects, and as a team we
							did some really cutting edge work. It was exciting work to say the least.

				<h4>Projects I've Created</h4>

				<p>
					<i>(I have a few more recent projects that are not online just yet that I would be willing to share.)</i>
				</p>

				<!-- variadic.js -->
				<h5>
					<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/willurd/variadic.js">variadic.js</a>
					<span>(JavaScript)</span>
				</h5>
				<p>A JavaScript library that cleans up your functions that accept different types and arrangements of arguments.</p>

				<!-- ScopeStatus -->
				<h5>
					<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/willurd/ScopeStatus">ScopeStatus</a>
					<span class="smaller text-muted">(Python)</span>
				</h5>

				<p>A Sublime Text plugin that, when activated, shows you the "scope" of the syntax at the current cursor position. This
					is useful when writing plugins or themes, as parts of a document are referenced by their scope.</p>

				<!-- js-lisp -->
				<h5>
					<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/willurd/js-lisp">js-lisp</a>
					<span class="smaller text-muted">(JavaScript, Lisp)</span>
				</h5>

				<p>A lisp interpreter that runs in the browser, written 100% in JavaScript. The project is old and the code is kind of gross,
					but it was super fun to write.</p>

				<p>I wrote quite a large suite of unit tests for this project. The tests are actually
					<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/willurd/js-lisp/blob/master/tests/tests.lisp">written in lisp</a>, and interpreted and run by the project itself, to test itself.</p>

				<h4>Contributions</h4>

				<!-- Vim -->
				<h5>Vim
					<span class="smaller text-muted">(C)</span>
				</h5>

				<p>Added a patch to Vim to allow users to specify what happens when a tab is closed. Before the patch, the tab to the right
					would be selected. The patch added a setting, and functionality, for selecting the tab to the left instead.</p>

				<!-- libcouchbase -->
				<h5>libcouchbase
					<span class="smaller text-muted">(C)</span>

				<p>Some changes were submitted as Paul Farag (a coworker who, at one point, was responsible for pushing contributions upstream
					to open source projects).</p>
