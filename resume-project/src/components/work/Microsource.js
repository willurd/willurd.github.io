    <p>
      I started Microsource Web Development when I was 18. I found two guys willing
      to back me and we registered an LLC and got to work. We had some local clients,
      made some websites, made some money, and had a blast. Owning my own company
      was a great experience that, even though the company eventually want under, I
      will always look back on fondly.
