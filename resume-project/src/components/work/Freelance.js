    <p>
      I started out in web design as a freelance designer. I've had the pleasure of
      working with some great companies like Access 360 Media (now Access Sports Media).
      I've had a wide range of responsibilities in my freelance work from the design
      and development of web sites and applications, to usability and interaction design
      and a touch of graphic design.
