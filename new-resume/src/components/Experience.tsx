            I have two decades of experience on the frontend, almost a decade of which has been spent building apps in
            React. I consider myself an expert in JavaScript/TypeScript, React, HTML, CSS, and everything that goes into
            engineering robust, reliable frontend applications for the browser. I also have a keen eye for UX and use
            that to keep a watchful eye out for the user and to more effectively communicate with designers.
